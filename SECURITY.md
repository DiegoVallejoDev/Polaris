## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of POLARIS seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Open a Public Issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report Privately

Instead, email security reports via the form on [diegovallejo.dev](diegovallejo.dev)

Include the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix & Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure within 90 days

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management

POLARIS handles sensitive API keys for AI providers. Please:

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secure vaults
- Rotate keys regularly
- Limit key permissions where possible

### Agent Output Security

- Agent outputs are not sanitized by default
- Validate and sanitize any output used in production
- Be aware that AI models can generate unexpected content
- Implement content filtering for user-facing applications

### Network Security

- All API calls use HTTPS by default
- Validate SSL certificates in production
- Consider request/response logging policies
- Implement rate limiting for production deployments

### Dependencies

We regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities:

```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

## Best Practices

### Development

1. Keep dependencies updated
2. Use TypeScript strict mode (enabled by default)
3. Validate all inputs to agents
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Use environment-specific configurations

### Production Deployment

1. Use secure environment variable management
2. Implement monitoring and logging
3. Set up alerting for unusual patterns
4. Regular security updates
5. Backup and recovery procedures

## Reporting Security Issues in Dependencies

If you discover a security issue in one of our dependencies:

1. Report to the dependency maintainer first
2. Notify us at [diego@diegovallejo.dev](mailto:diego@diegovallejo.dev)
3. We will coordinate updates and releases
