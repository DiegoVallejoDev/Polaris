**POLARIS** (Policy Optimization via Layered Agents and Recursive Inference Search) is a novel decision-making framework designed to simulate parallel lines of reasoning across agents with varied internal parameters. It extends Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) by embedding agent diversity at each node and introducing a meta-evaluator called the **Sentinel Agent**, which provides external, corrective insight during the backpropagation phase.

## 🎉 **Current Status: Production-Ready Framework**

✅ **Working Demo Available** - Run `npm run example:foundation`  
✅ **Complete Implementation** - All core components functional  
✅ **TypeScript Ready** - Full type safety and modern architecture  
✅ **Advanced AI Features** - Bias detection, diversity analysis, meta-cognitive oversight

## Key Concepts

### Layered Cognitive Reasoning

Inspired by Daniel Kahneman’s _Thinking, Fast and Slow_, POLARIS organizes decision-making in layers:

_Reflex < Impulse < Heuristic < Deliberation < Meta-Reasoning < Polaris_

This layered framework mirrors the spectrum of cognition—from the instinctual responses of System 1 to the methodical analysis of System 2—and then goes a step further. POLARIS does not merely alternate between fast and slow thinking; it _orchestrates_ them. By embedding a variety of agents at each node—ranging from reactive evaluators to symbolic reasoners or large language models—POLARIS constructs a collaborative battlefield of perspectives.

This is where the innovation lies: instead of choosing the best single model, POLARIS creates an ecosystem of thought. Each simulation is not just a roll of the dice, but a simulated debate, with the **Sentinel Agent** acting as a moderator who watches the entire tree, evaluates diversity, coherence, and surprise, and selectively reinforces strategies that reflect strategic adaptability and long-term insight.

This approach is not just scalable. It's epistemologically _layered_.

Each POLARIS node represents a snapshot of deliberation made by an agent with slightly different internal reasoning biases, allowing for a rich landscape of possible outcomes to be explored.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/DiegoVallejoDev/Polaris.git
cd Polaris
npm install

# Build the framework
npm run build

# Run the foundation demo
npm run example:foundation
```

## 📦 **Installation**

```bash
npm install polaris-framework
```

```typescript
import {
  PolarisEngine,
  SentinelAgent,
  SearchAlgorithm,
  AgentSelector,
} from "polaris-framework";

// Create agents with different reasoning styles
const agents = [
  new OpenAIAgent({ model: "gpt-4", temperature: 0.7 }),
  new MinimaxAgent({ maxDepth: 8 }),
  new CustomAgent({ strategy: "aggressive" }),
];

// Configure the Sentinel for bias detection
const sentinel = new SentinelAgent({
  diversityThreshold: 0.3,
  biasDetectionEnabled: true,
  correctionStrength: 0.5,
});

// Run POLARIS search
const result = await polaris.search(gameState);
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Core Components**

#### **🎯 MCTS with Agent Diversity**

- **Multi-Agent Search**: Unlike traditional MCTS, POLARIS coordinates multiple heterogeneous agents
- **Selection Strategies**: Round-robin, performance-based, diversity-maximizing, adaptive
- **Progressive Widening**: Efficient action space exploration
- **Early Termination**: Smart stopping conditions based on confidence and score differences

#### **🛡️ Sentinel Agent System**

The Sentinel Agent acts as a meta-observer during search:

- **Bias Detection**: Identifies 6 types of bias (systematic, temporal, positional, confirmation, anchoring, groupthink)
- **Diversity Analysis**: Measures evaluation quality and prevents groupthink
- **Score Correction**: Applies intelligent corrections based on detected issues
- **Intervention Tracking**: Learns from past corrections for continuous improvement

#### **🧮 Advanced Mathematics**

- **Statistical Analysis**: Entropy, variance, correlation, UCB1 calculations
- **Normalization**: Score standardization across different agent types
- **Seeded Randomness**: Reproducible results for testing and debugging

## ✨ **Key Features**

### **Agent-Agnostic Design**

POLARIS works with any agent that implements the `Agent` interface:

```typescript
interface Agent {
  evaluate(state: GameState): Promise<EvaluationResult>;
  selectAction(state: GameState, actions: Action[]): Promise<Action>;
}
```

### **Meta-Cognitive Oversight**

The Sentinel Agent provides "System 2" thinking that observes and corrects the search process:

- Detects when agents are too similar (groupthink)
- Identifies systematic biases in evaluations
- Applies corrections to improve decision quality
- Tracks intervention effectiveness over time

### **Production-Ready Architecture**

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and comprehensive error reporting
- **Memory Management**: Efficient tree pruning and memory-aware operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed statistics and performance metrics
