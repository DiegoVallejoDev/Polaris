# Console Output Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to make POLARIS console output much cleaner and more readable.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **API Key Exposure** ❌ → ✅

**Before:** Full API keys were exposed in error logs

**After:** API keys are safely masked

### 2. **Massive Error Objects** ❌ → ✅

**Before:** Full Axios error objects with hundreds of lines of internal properties

```javascript
{
  _events: [Object: null prototype],
  _eventsCount: 7,
  _maxListeners: undefined,
  outputData: [],
  outputSize: 0,
  writable: true,
  destroyed: true,
  _last: false,
  chunkedEncoding: false,
  // ... 200+ more lines of internal Node.js properties
}
```

**After:** Clean, concise error information

```javascript
{
  message: 'Request failed with status code 429',
  status: 429,
  statusText: 'Too Many Requests',
  code: 'ERR_BAD_REQUEST',
  url: '[API_ENDPOINT]/chat/completions',
  method: 'POST',
  data: { error: '[Object]' }
}
```

### 3. **Poor Error Handling** ❌ → ✅

**Before:** Raw error dumps with stack traces

```
❌ Error: AxiosError: Request failed with status code 429 at settle (C:\Users\...\axios\lib\core\settle.js:19:12) at IncomingMessage.handleStreamEnd...
```

**After:** Clean, user-friendly messages

```
❌ Error: Request failed with status code 429
   📊 Status: 429 Too Many Requests
   Code: ERR_BAD_REQUEST
```

### 4. **Verbose Rate Limit Messages** ❌ → ✅

**Before:**

```
Rate limit hit, retrying in 30000ms (attempt 2/3)
```

**After:**

```
Rate limit exceeded, retrying in 30s (attempt 2/3)
```

## New Features

### 1. **Safe Error Logging**

Added `logger.errorSafe()` method that automatically sanitizes sensitive data from error objects.

### 2. **API Key Masking**

- Detects API keys, tokens, and other sensitive data
- Shows first 4 and last 4 characters: `sk-pr****R0YA`
- Masks authorization headers and config objects

### 3. **Clean Test Output**

New `test:clean-output` script demonstrates the improved output:

```bash
pnpm run test:clean-output
```

```

## Configuration Options

You can control log verbosity by setting environment variables:

```bash
# Reduce verbosity for cleaner output
POLARIS_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Or for maximum verbosity during debugging
POLARIS_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## Usage

### For Development

Use the full test suite that includes all agents:

```bash
pnpm run test:web-agents
```

### For Clean Demo

Use the clean output demo that skips problematic APIs:

```bash
pnpm run test:clean-output
```

## Benefits

1. **🔒 Security**: No more API key exposure in logs
2. **📖 Readability**: Clean, concise error messages
3. **🐛 Debugging**: Still shows essential error information
4. **⚡ Performance**: Faster log processing with sanitized objects
5. **👥 User-Friendly**: Professional output suitable for demos

The console output is now production-ready and safe for sharing or displaying to users without exposing sensitive information.
